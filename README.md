The idea for it arose as a result of the need to collect data from other websites in an automated way, replacing manual
copying.

An example of use would be to download a list of top videos from a video ranking page.

### Functionalities:

* User registration with e-mail confirmation of account activation
* User login and logout
* Change of user data and password
* Adding pages to collect data
* Collecting data from the added page based on CSS classes and saving to the database
* Display of collected data in tabular form
* Downloading reports in xlsx format with collected data
* Access to the user list for a user with administrator privileges

#### Technologies used:

Java 8, JSP, JSTL, JavaScript, MySQL, Spring Framework (Core, MVC, Form, Security, Boot, Validation).

Project is still in development phase. In case of suggestions, do not hesitate to reach to me.
